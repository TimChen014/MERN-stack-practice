# React - Node.js - Express - MongoDB exercise

This is a small project to view patient order, edit and store these changes in a database.


After initializing the MongoDB database and the server, please run "node init.js" for posting patient and order data to the database.

```console
. > mongod
./backend > nodemon server.js
./frontend/src > node init.js
```

Then you can type in npm start in the project directory to start up the project:

```console
./frontend/src > npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
